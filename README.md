img.go - README
===============

img.go is a proof of concept for image operations using Golang. It started
 its life inspired by an "Images with all colors" challenge 
(http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors), 
which then evolved into a platform to experiment with Golang features (such 
as Goroutines).
